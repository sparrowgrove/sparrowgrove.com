  You got the black & white photogragaphs  strung up in the time line<BR />
  but it's missing one important thing<BR />
  the feelings we had that first night<BR />
  confussed and scared. 
  
  You take my hand and whisper 
  some words in my ear
  It made my knees weak 
  when I heard you say
  
  You mean the world to me
  and I want to be with you
  forever You are mine
  so how do I show you
  
  
  
  ----------------------------
  
  You call me up late at night
  cause you need to talk
  I shuffle out of bed
  Move some place quiet
  
  I start off saying
  do you know what time it is
  and thats when you break down
  You tell me whats wrong
  and I begin to cry
  
  I felt my heart break
  and I tell you I gotta go
  After a few more drinks
  I call you back so mad
